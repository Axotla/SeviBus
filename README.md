# WARNING
This code is **not** nice. Is **not** clean. Doesn't follow good practices. 

And above all, **it doesn't reflect the way I work** and how I write software nowdays.

It is an old project that I made and evolved as a student some years ago, that is still published and people use it. 
I intend to keep improving it in my spare time, but I don't expect do turn it into a piece of code I'm proud of showing.

Improvements and contributions are of course welcome.
